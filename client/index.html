			<h3>PERSONAL</h3>
			<p>I identify as a perfectionist who learned that practicality and punctuality are just as pertinent. That being said, however, I can just as easily call myself a dreamer void of reason. I say this because I recognize that the common delusions of grandeur that roam my thoughts are not so common for others. Consequently, I will not settle for anything less than a legacy to leave behind on this earth. My playtime, my relationships, my work and anything that I do is backed by a love of life and a love for others... in a deep but platonic kind of way. My enemy is not others' dreams but the doubt that sprouts from within me.
			</p>
			<p>
			Different people live different lives and, well, live for different reasons. I live for experience over living for objects. The reason being that knowledge is addicting, not to say that accumulating things isn't, but my knowledge informs me that objects are less engaging than the knowledge used to interact with objects. Thus, I choose the more rich in entertainment. My interest in experience, however, is just an interest and not a direct correlation to my intelligence. I'm just average with a hint of weird, which I suppose is just like most people. I have to say I enjoy the view from atop this bell curve, it's quite holistic.

			<h3>EDUCATION</h3>
			<p>Thus far in my life, I have paper proof of earning a BS degree and will soon have proof of attending a full-stack coding bootcamp put on by Coding Dojo. From my BS degree, I gave the most focus on learning the <span class="skillset">Psychology</span> of learning... or learning how to learn. This is a skill set valuable to any and every profession because of its adaptability to interacting with any subject and all people. 
			The full-stack development basics that I have learned so far yield for me an understanding and a practical use of computer programming languages such as <span class="skillset">Python</span>, <span class="skillset">Ruby</span> and <span class="skillset">JavaScript</span>, database basics in <span class="skillset">MySQL</span> and <span class="skillset">MongoDB</span>, frontend techniques aptly used such as <span class="skillset">HTML</span>, <span class="skillset">CSS</span>, <span class="skillset">JQuery</span> and <span class="skillset">AngularJS</span>, and some other things listed in my Resum√©.

			<h3>ASPIRATIONS</h3>
			<p>
			My professional goals are to master front-end and back-end techniques and to keep up to date on new softwares. I also plan to formally continue my education in mathematics and human computer interaction... but that's a few years off, hey, I'm only 21. Some of the immediate and long term pieces, respectively, for me to master are:
			<ul id="nowgoal">
				<li>Photoshop</li>
				<li>AJAX</li>
				<li>Bootstrap</li>
				<li>OOP</li>
				<li>SEO</li>
				<li>E-commerce</li>
			</ul>
			<ul id="latergoal">
				<li>Big O Notation</li>
				<li>Security</li>
				<li>TDD</li>
				<li>Memory Management</li>
			</ul>
